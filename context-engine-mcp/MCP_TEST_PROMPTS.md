```

## üìù Example Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Context Management
```
1. "Switch to tenant: zamaz-enterprise"
2. "Store product catalog with 1000 items"
3. "Find products similar to 'organic coffee beans'"
4. "Generate inventory forecast for next quarter"
5. "Create workflow for low-stock alerts"
```

### Scenario 2: Code Analysis Pipeline
```

## üîç Validation Checklist

When testing, verify:
- [ ] Correct response format
- [ ] Appropriate error messages
- [ ] Response time within limits
- [ ] Context properly stored/retrieved
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation working
- [ ] Tools executing correctly
- [ ] Agents collaborating effectively
- [ ] Memory persistence functioning
- [ ] Vector search returning relevant results
- [ ] Workflows completing successfully

## üöÄ Advanced Testing

### Load Testing
```python
# Simulate concurrent users
for i in range(100):
    "Process order #{i} with standard workflow"
```

### Stress Testing
```
"Generate and index 10000 random documents"
"Perform 1000 similarity searches"
"Create nested workflow with 50 steps"
```

### Chaos Testing
```
"Interrupt workflow execution at step 3"
"Simulate network timeout during API call"
"Force agent communication failure"
"Trigger out-of-memory condition"
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic operations before complex workflows
2. **Test Isolation**: Verify multi-tenant separation thoroughly
3. **Monitor Resources**: Watch memory and CPU during tests
4. **Document Issues**: Keep track of any unexpected behaviors
5. **Incremental Complexity**: Gradually increase test complexity
6. **Real-World Scenarios**: Test with actual use cases from Zamaz

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Commands

```
"Show debug info for last operation"
"Enable verbose logging"
"Trace workflow execution"
"Display system metrics"
"Export diagnostic report"
```

Remember: The current implementation has simulated responses. Once fully integrated with the MCP backend, these prompts will trigger actual AI processing, tool execution, and workflow management.
