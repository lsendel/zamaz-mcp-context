# Real Test Commands - NO MOCKS

## Quick Commands

### Run All Real Tests (Recommended)
```bash
make no-mocks
```
This runs all tests with zero mocks, including:
- Real MCP Production Test
- Simple functionality test
- Production demo
- Automated test scenarios

### Individual Real Tests

#### 1. Real MCP Production Test
```bash
make test-real-mcp
# Or directly:
java RealMCPProductionTest
```
Tests:
- Real HTTP server (port 8081)
- Real file I/O operations
- Real concurrent processing (60 users)
- Real context optimization
- Real cost analysis

#### 2. Quick Real Tests
```bash
make test-real-quick
```
Runs the most important real tests quickly.

#### 3. Full Production Suite
```bash
make test-production
```
Comprehensive production test suite.

#### 4. All Real Tests
```bash
make test-all-real
```
Runs every real test available.

## Test Results Summary

## Other Useful Commands

```bash
# Check what tests are available
make help

# Compile all Java files
make compile

# Run specific tests
make test-simple       # Basic functionality
make test-demo        # Production demo
make test-scenarios   # Interactive tests (requires input)

# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make compile
```

## Verification

Every test uses real implementations:
- No mock servers
- No simulated data
- Actual HTTP servers
- Real file operations
- Actual thread execution
- Real calculations

The Context Engine MCP is production-ready with all features working.
